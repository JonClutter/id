This will be my tagline:
Creative and Clear

This will be my introductory text, a paragraph(s) totaling at least 150 words that welcome user, state the goal of the portfolio website, and describe my ambitions and something positive I feel about working in web:
Hello, my name is Jonathan Clutter. I have four years of academic training in the multimedia and design field of study. I graduated from Jefferson County Joint Vocational School with Certificate of Completion in Multimedia and Design. I am currently a student and a teacher assistant at Pittsburgh Technical College. I am getting an Associate in Science Degree in Multimedia Technologies with a concentration in Web Design and Development.
I enjoy coding JavaScript and PHP. Getting a page to understand the user or read a database is interesting to me. The problem solving with coding is fascinating to me and satisfying to finally figure the solution out. Though, it isnâ€™t always about back-end code. I enjoy doing layout design code also. CSS Grid, Flex, and Bootstraps are what I like to use most of the time.
This website showcases my finest works in web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP.

Here is a piece description for one piece that my portfolio will show, following the format outlined on Blackboard:
